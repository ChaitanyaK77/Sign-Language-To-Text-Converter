First Prototype built - 31st August 2023
--used multiple Convolutional Neural Network Models with tweaks and tunes

("I applied multiple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models and fine-tuned each of them by adjusting hyperparameters, modifying architectures, and experimenting with various optimization techniques.")

Final Project underway!!
